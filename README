## Data Cleaning Notes

- Unioned zip codes, then filled in "islands" which are likely also flooded
- This filling in process also mean a few administrative zip codes (like federal buidings, Howard Univ Hospital, etc) and one residential zipcode (20059) were included in flood zone.
- All input datasets were saved as geoparquet files
- Manually compiled list of senior wellness centers from DC DHS website
